Traffic Analysis Project for the University Heights Association

A live version of this is available [here](http://52.39.134.145/university-heights-association/heatmap.html) with .htpasswd usernamne/password noventum / Ea5%003V5yvr. 

Here's the general idea:

1. Ingest data into database
2. Query database to generate JSON
3. Consume JSON in Google Maps JavaScript app
4. .
5. .
6. . ???
7. Help my neighborhood association analyze traffic wreck data to make informed decisions, instead of decisions based on feelings.

One example of a decision is to request a traffic study. We went with Silver Ave, since there are a lot of new roadway markings there. Another example is to support, or not, the city's position on their Albuquerque Rapid Transit project. One of the claims of which was that it would make Central "safer" (safer than what?)
